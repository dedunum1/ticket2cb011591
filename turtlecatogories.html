        <h1>TURTLE CATOGORIES</h1>
        <P>Turtles play a significant role in Sri Lanka's coastal ecosystems and have been an integral part of the country's natural heritage for centuries. Sri Lanka is known for its diverse turtle population, with several species inhabiting its surrounding oceans and nesting along its beaches. Here is some information about turtles in Sri Lanka <br>
            <br>

            1. Nesting Sites: Sri Lanka is renowned for being a crucial nesting ground for sea turtles. The island's sandy beaches provide ideal conditions for nesting, attracting various turtle species from around the world. These nesting sites are carefully monitored and protected to ensure the survival of turtle populations.
            <br>
            <br>
            2. Olive Ridley Turtles: Olive Ridley Turtles (Lepidochelys olivacea) are the most abundant sea turtle species in Sri Lanka. They are relatively small and known for their synchronized nesting behavior called arribadas. Thousands of Olive Ridley Turtles come ashore simultaneously to lay their eggs, creating an awe-inspiring spectacle.
            <br>
            <br>
            3. Conservation Efforts: Sri Lanka has implemented numerous conservation initiatives to protect its turtle population. Several turtle hatcheries and conservation projects have been established along the coast, aiming to safeguard nesting sites, monitor nesting activity, and raise awareness about the importance of turtle conservation.
            <br>
            <br>
            4. Threats: Turtles in Sri Lanka face various threats, including habitat destruction, pollution, bycatch in fishing nets, and poaching. Eggs and adult turtles are vulnerable to human activities, such as the illegal trade in turtle products. These challenges highlight the need for continuous conservation efforts to ensure the survival of turtle species.
            <br>
            <br>
            5. Marine Protected Areas: Sri Lanka has designated marine protected areas (MPAs) to conserve its diverse marine ecosystems, including turtle habitats. These MPAs provide a safe environment for turtles to feed, breed, and nest. Some popular MPAs for turtle conservation in Sri Lanka include Pigeon Island National Park and Rekawa Turtle Conservation Project.
            <br>
            <br>
            6. Turtle Watching and Volunteer Programs: Sri Lanka offers opportunities for visitors to witness turtle nesting and hatching through responsible turtle watching programs. These programs provide education about turtle conservation and the chance to participate in volunteer activities, such as releasing hatchlings into the ocean.
            <br>
            <br>
            It is essential to respect and support conservation efforts when visiting Sri Lanka's turtle habitats. Responsible tourism and adherence to guidelines help protect these magnificent creatures and contribute to their long-term survival.</P>

           <p>The Green Turtle is the most commonly found turtle in Sri Lanka. They are also found in the Indian, Pacific and Atlantic Oceans. Luckily this practice is less common today. Young Green Turtles are mainly carnivores. Adults however are herbivores, feeding only on marine vegetation with the help of their finely serrated jaws.They grow to a maximum length of 1m and can weigh 250kg. Adult females lay between 120-140 eggs at one time.</p>

            The critically endangered Hawksbill Turtle is rarer than the Green Turtle. It is also much smaller, reaching a maximum length of 90cm and weighing 50-70kg.The Hawksbill gets its English name from its narrow head and bird-like beak, which is used to catch animals hiding in small crevices. It is a regular visitor to Sri Lanka and other tropical and subtropical waters. Although one of the smaller species of sea turtle, it is renowned for its beautiful shell, which is made up of 13 symmetrical pieces and is very colourful. </p>

        <p>This turtle is endangered because the population depends on the security of a small number of beaches found in the Indian, Pacific and Atlantic Oceans.The smallest of the sea turtles and one of the two species of ridley turtle, the Olive Ridley reaches a maximum size of 65cm and weighs 35-45kg. It is named after its olive/rust coloured shell.Olive Ridley Turtles nest yearly, and many lay their eggs on Kosgoda Beach, depositing more than 150 at one time. They are omnivores, eating crustaceans, fish and some marine vegetation.</p>

        <p>This critically endangered turtle is the largest of the 5 species and is a rare find in Sri Lanka. It remains on the brink of extinction.
            It is easily identifiable due to its long front flippers and unique black and white stripy shell - its carapace is in fact a layer of thin, tough, rubbery skin peppered with thousands of bone plates giving it a leathery appearance. It is in fact the only sea turtle that lacks a hard shell In addition, they have a unique blood circulatory system for a cold-blooded reptile which means they are able to keep their blood warm even in cold waters using metabolic heat from their muscle activity. The Leatherback reaches a maximum length of 3m and a weight of 750kg. Their unique flexible carapace and its seven ridges enable them to dive to depths of 1500m in search of their favourite food, the jellyfish            
            Around 5 Leatherback Turtles are known to nest at Kosgoda Beach each year.</p>
